3. extract luarocks.exe and luarocks-admin.exe to the directory C:\Program Files \(x86\)\luarocks
   1. \(doesn't matter where as long as the directory you place it gets put in the PATH variable\)
4. add luarocks directory to the [PATH in system environment variables](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) \(not user specific variables\)
